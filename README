BORIS BIKES -- Week 3 CHALLENGE -- set by @shadchnev

Goal was to introduce us to Object-Oriented Programming and Object-Oriented Design.

We were asked to create a simple system for managing Boris bikes in London. The system should keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes, allow users to rent the bikes and return them. Broken bikes were to be made unavailable for rental, and could be taken to a garage for repairs.
